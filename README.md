raspScratch
===========

Goal of this project is to try to build a linux from scratch (or nearly) for the raspberry Pi target. This will be done only to learn the build process for cross toolchain and linux

Roadmap :

1. Building the toolchain using crosstool-ng

2. Building the linux kernel using basic default configuration
2.1  Add a kernel module
2.2  Reconfigure the kernel to minimalize the features

3. Build the rootfs 
 ... not clearly defined yet...
